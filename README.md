### Oh, hello there 👋
I am an insatiably curious and idealistically driven full-stack JavaScript addict with a passion for creation, expression, and the platforms which facilitate them.

## :mag_right: Focus

 ### :notebook: **Learning** <img align="right" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=bosconian-dynamics&count_private=true&show_icons=true&hide_border=true" />
  - Contemporary PHP structure and toolchains (Composer, PHPCS, PHPUnit)
  - Building and testing automation (GitHub Workflows)
  - Filling in gaps in my knowledge of and getting up to speed with recent developments in familiar technologies (PHP, React, Webpack, Next.js)
 ### :art: **Creating**
  - Contributing to the WordPress/Gutenberg project
  - Developing on top of Gutenberg to improve my comprehension of the platform
  - A blog, finally!
  - Building out small open-source plugins and projects for interested parties
 ### :eyeglasses: **Aspiring**
  - Make some sort of income through my open source work and projects
  - A career working with passionate people concerned with more than "the bottom line" (e.g. creativity, education, mental health, or social justice)

I use Pluralsight's Skill Assessments and structured video content to improve my familiarity with various technologies and identify gaps in my knowledge.
