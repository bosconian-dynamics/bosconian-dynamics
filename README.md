### Oh, hello there ðŸ‘‹
I am an insatiably curious and idealistically driven full-stack JavaScript addict with a passion for creation, expression, and the platforms which facilitate them.

## Current Focus

 - Learning to right cleaner, more maintainable PHP on top of the language's emerging feature set.
 - Using larger contemporary toolchains to better write, test, and deploy my code, including software like Webpack, Eslint, PHPCS, Composer, GitHub Actions, PHPUnit, and more.
 - Learning to better leverage GitHub to collaborate

Over the course of 2020 I've become fond of the guidance which Pluralsight's Skill Assessments offer in sharpening my knowledge of and familiarity with various technologies - as well as the platform's video content for introductory exposure and identifying gaps in my experience.
